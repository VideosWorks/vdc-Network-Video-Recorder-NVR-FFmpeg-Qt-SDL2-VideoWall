Missing features in v0.5.0:
- bind a SQLITE_STATIC value (string/blob)
- bind a dynamic value with zerocopy (unlike SQLITE_TRANSIENT) with custom deleter
- getColumnByName ? std::map getRow() ?

Missing documentation in v0.5.0:
- This wrapper is not thread safe: compare to the thread safety of the SQLite3 library
- explain the noncopyable property for RAII design
- comment on returning error code instead of exception that shall not be thrown when exepected (!?)

Advanced missing features:
- backup support to/from file/:memory:
- Function ?
- Agregate ?
- support for different transaction mode ? NO: too specific
- operator<< binding ? NO: redundant with bind()
- ATTACH Database ? NO: can already be done by "ATTACH" Statement
- Add optional usage of experimental sqlite3_trace() function to enable statistics
